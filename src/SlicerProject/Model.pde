/*
Model.pde

This Sketchbook tab holds the definition and implementation of the Model class.

The Model class serves as a central object to hold the 3d model currently being
 processed. It also contains various methods to manipulate the model, including scaling
 and rotations. Performing these modifications results in the facets that make up the
 object being modified, along with properties that hold information about these
 modifications. Finally, the Model class also provides a method to obtain strings
 that make up an STL file that represents the current state of the model.
